# Platform Agnostic Infrastructure

Often the most difficult part for Enterprises in working across multiple teams, is leveraging problem solving capabilities of resources against existing infrastructure. The configuration driven nature of the Fathym Ecosystem is purpose built to help
teams solve problems in consistent and scalable architectures that are crafted for the Enterprise, in order to enable rapid and
transformative (capable of transcending the changes and evolution of technology....).

## Choosing Your Starting Infrastructure

As a starting point for the entire Fathym Infrastructure, you will need to decide how you want to host your infrastructure.  This won't be set in stone, and any logical migration is possible with minimal downtime.  For ready-to-be-production environments, it is recommended to start with the Enterprise Infrastructure option.

### Fathym Explorer Infrastructure

If you do nothing, and configure no information for the infrastructure solution you will be utilizing the shared Fathym Hosting space. While we do our best to keep these assets up and running, it does not come without restrictions. We constantly monitor the activity of our shared infrastructure and any accounts found to be abusing the "explorer" nature of our shared infrastructure will be asked to upgrade (and supported in such efforts) to our Managed or Enterprise Infrastructure offerings. We do our best to ensure
no downtime and provide ease of migration, however it is always best to start with our Managed or Enterprise offerings.

### Fathym Hosted Infrastructure

Not every team is equipped with the right sources to be managing Azure, AWS, or any other infrastructure in anyway shape or form.  If that is your team, than Fathym Hosted Infrastructure is the right choice for you.  We'll get you setup quickly, in an isolated and secure Infrastructure subscription with Azure.  We'll manage the billing, setup, maintenance and compliance, you'll just recieve a single bill at the end of the month for all infrastructure associated with your account.

To get started with hosted plan, contact your sales representative and we'll take the rest of the setup on our hands.  In the mean time, you can get started in the same way as the Explorer, and we'll upgrade your account when setup is complete.

### Fathym Enterprise Infrastructure

Ok, so you still might need to explore our offerings, but if you want to do that within the security and control of your Enterprise infrastructure then this is the option for you.  Configure your existing infrastructure against the available solution offerings and create a secure and scalable way to solve problems for your Enterprise.

#### Setting Up an Enterprise Azure Infrastructure

This is the most secure and scalable way to move forward.  There are a few steps we need to go through to get everything setup, and then you can continue exploring the Fathym Ecosyste solutions with provisioning in your own infrastructure.

## Long Term Goals

While existing partnerships and customer efforts continue to drive our efforts against the Azure service offerings, everything is architected to support the implementation of other platforms like AWS and Google. Contact our team for support on building solutions against these other platforms.
